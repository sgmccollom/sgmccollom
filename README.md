### Hi there, 👋 I'm Stephanie.

I'm a full stack software engineer 👩‍💻 based in Chicago, IL. Prior to my career in Software Engineering, I was a Production Manager where my focus was overseeing budgets, schedules and communication of animated television programs. Now, I love to solve complex problems in the software engineering space.

Recently, I created [Laridae](https://laridae-migrations.github.io/), an open-source, zero-downtime, reversible database schema migration tool for PostgreSQL integrated into a deployment pipeline hosted on GitHub Actions.
